### Assignment

1. Realize your own promiseAll function which will work the same way as Promise.all from JS, you can't use Promise.all in your function.
   ```
   The Promise.all() static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single Promise. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises fulfill (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of the fulfillment values. It rejects when any of the input's promises rejects, with this first rejection reason.
   ```
